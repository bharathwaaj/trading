# Options Trading Journal

Welcome to my options trading journal! This repository is where I document my daily trading journey, focusing on self-improvement, discipline, and managing emotions like greed, fear, and confidence. It serves as a tool to help me stay consistent, reflect on my progress, and grow as a trader.

## Purpose

This journal isn’t about automation, coding, or technical strategies. Instead, it’s a personal log that helps me:
- Develop discipline and stick to my trading rules.
- Manage emotions such as greed, fear, and anger during trades.
- Build confidence and stay grounded, even in challenging market conditions.
- Review my trades and reflect on what went well and what didn’t.
- Set and achieve realistic trading goals.

## Structure

Here’s an overview of the key sections in this journal:

### 1. Pre-Market Analysis
A daily log where I analyze the market conditions before the trading day begins. This section includes key insights, market levels, and other factors that might influence my trading decisions.

### 2. Daily Journal
A daily entry documenting my trades, thoughts, and emotions. I reflect on how well I followed my plan and handled the emotional aspects of trading.

### 3. Reflections
Deep dives into specific emotional challenges like greed, fear, and confidence. Here, I explore strategies for managing these emotions and improving my mental game.

### 4. Goals and Plans

Periodic reviews where I assess my progress, identify areas for improvement, and celebrate wins. This includes weekly and monthly reviews, as well as key lessons learned.

## How I Use This Journal

Each day, I start with a pre-market analysis to prepare mentally for the trading day. After the market closes, I document my trades and reflect on my performance in the daily journal. Regularly, I review my reflections, goals, and trading rules to ensure I’m staying on track.

## My Approach to Trading

My trading is guided by principles like:
- **Discipline**: Sticking to my rules no matter what.
- **Emotional Control**: Recognizing and managing emotions in real-time.
- **Continuous Learning**: Analyzing mistakes and learning from them.

This journal is my attempt to keep myself accountable and continuously improve as a trader.
