# Daily Journal

This folder contains daily reflections on my trading day. The goal is to track how well I adhered to my trading rules, how I handled emotions like greed and fear, and what I can learn from each day.

## How I Use It

- **Emotional Check-In**: How I felt before, during, and after trading.
- **Trade Summary**: A quick recap of the trades I took, why I took them, and how they played out.
- **Lessons Learned**: Insights gained from the day’s trades and emotional responses.
- **Action Plan**: What I’ll focus on improving tomorrow.

## Organization

Entries are organized by year and then by month, with each day’s journal entry saved as a markdown file named by date.
