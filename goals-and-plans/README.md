# Goals and Plans

This folder contains my trading goals, plans, and rules. It serves as a roadmap for staying focused, disciplined, and consistent in my trading journey.

## Sections

- **Weekly Plan**: A weekly action plan that aligns with my monthly goals.
- **Trading Rules**: The core rules I follow to stay disciplined and avoid emotional decision-making.
