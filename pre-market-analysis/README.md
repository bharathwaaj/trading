# Pre-Market Analysis

This folder contains my daily pre-market analysis notes. These notes provide insights into market conditions, key levels, news, and other factors that might influence my trading decisions.

## How I Use It

- **Market Overview**: A brief analysis of global market trends and any significant overnight news.
- **Key Levels**: Support and resistance levels for the day.
- **Trading Plan**: Strategies I’m considering based on the market setup.

## Organization

The analysis is organized by year and then by month (named instead of numbered). Each day’s analysis is recorded in a markdown file named by the date.
