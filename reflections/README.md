# Reflections

This folder contains deeper reflections on key emotional and psychological challenges in trading, such as discipline, greed, fear, confidence, and anger. I explore strategies for managing these emotions and improving my mental game here.

## Topics Covered

- **Discipline**: How to stick to my trading rules consistently.
- **Greed**: Recognizing and controlling the desire for excessive profits.
- **Fear**: Overcoming fear of losing and fear of missing out (FOMO).
- **Confidence**: Building and maintaining self-confidence in my trading abilities.
- **Anger**: Managing frustration and anger after tough days.

## Organization

Each topic has its own markdown file, making it easy to reference and update as I refine my strategies.
