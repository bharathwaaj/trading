## Checklist for Daily Analysis

### 1. **Market Overview**

- **Global Market Sentiment:** Briefly analyze major global indices (e.g., S&P 500, FTSE, Nikkei) and any significant moves in commodities or currencies that could impact your market.
- **News and Economic Events:** Highlight any major news, economic reports, or earnings releases scheduled for the day that could drive market volatility.

### 2. **Technical Analysis**

- **Index/Market Levels:** Identify key support and resistance levels for major indices and the securities you trade. Track trends, moving averages, and significant price zones.
- **Trend Analysis:** Determine the prevailing trend (bullish, bearish, or sideways) and whether the market is likely to continue in that direction.
- **Indicators and Oscillators:** Track technical indicators like RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, or moving averages to assess momentum, overbought/oversold conditions, and potential reversals.

### 3. **Trade Setups and Watchlist**

- **Potential Trade Setups:** List the securities or instruments you’re watching closely for the day. Clearly define the criteria for entry and exit, such as breakouts, pullbacks, or patterns like head and shoulders or double tops.
- **Entry and Exit Points:** Identify specific levels or conditions that would trigger a trade. For example, “Buy at 50000 if price breaks above with volume confirmation.”
- **Risk-Reward Analysis:** Evaluate the risk-reward ratio for each setup to ensure it aligns with your trading strategy (e.g., 1:2 or better).

### 4. **Pre-Market and Opening Insights**

- **Pre-Market Movement:** Note how the market or specific stocks are behaving pre-market. Is there strong buying or selling pressure?
- **Gap Analysis:** If the market opens with a gap up or down, assess whether it’s likely to fill or continue trending in the direction of the gap.
- **First 30-Minute Analysis:** After the market opens, review the initial price action. This can set the tone for the day (e.g., breakout continuation, choppy range-bound).

### 5. **Trading Plan for the Day**

- **Primary Strategy:** Define your primary strategy for the day (e.g., trend following, mean reversion, breakout trading).
- **Plan A and Plan B:** Have a contingency plan if the market doesn’t behave as expected. For instance, if a breakout fails, be ready to pivot to a range-trading strategy.
- **Position Sizing and Risk Management:** Set rules for position sizing and stop-loss levels based on your account size and risk tolerance.

### 6. **Emotional Check-In and Mindset Preparation**

- **Assess Your Emotional State:** Are you feeling anxious, overconfident, or distracted? Being aware of your emotions can prevent impulsive decisions.
- **Mental Reminders:** Reiterate your core principles, such as “Stick to the plan,” “No revenge trading,” or “Take small, high-probability trades.”
- **Set Clear Goals:** Define what success looks like for the day beyond just making profits. This could be something like “Follow my rules 100%” or “Stay patient and wait for the best setups.”

### 7. **Review of Past Mistakes and Lessons Learned**

- **Yesterday’s Performance Review:** Briefly reflect on the previous trading day. What went well? What could be improved? Did you follow your rules?
- **Avoiding Repeated Mistakes:** Identify any bad habits (e.g., cutting profits too early, holding onto losing trades too long) and make a plan to avoid them today.

### 8. **Post-Market Reflection (After Market Close)**

- **Review of Executed Trades:** Analyze each trade you took, focusing on whether it followed your plan and rules.
- **Missed Opportunities:** Document setups that you didn’t take but were in line with your strategy. Why did you miss them? Was it due to hesitation, lack of confidence, or simply not noticing?
- **Daily Summary:** Write a brief summary of the day, noting key insights, lessons learned, and adjustments to make for tomorrow.

### 9. **Continuous Improvement and Strategy Adjustments**

- **Strategy Tweaks:** Based on today’s performance, are there any minor adjustments needed for tomorrow? This could include tightening stop-loss levels or being more selective with entry criteria.
- **Feedback Loop:** Incorporate feedback from your journal and daily analysis into future trading plans. This creates a continuous cycle of learning and improvement.
